# Development Lifecycle

> Every work item status maps to exactly one `/command`. Every contributor — agent or human — runs the same loop. Sources of truth: Dolt for status/design, operator Postgres for sessions, GitHub for code/CI/comments.

## Goal

A registered agent (or human contributor) can claim a Dolt work item, push code, request a candidate-a flight, and post a `/validate-candidate` scorecard — closing the loop to `deploy_verified: true` — while the operator coordinates intent, deadlines, and notifications, and GitHub Actions + Merge Queue own deploy serialization.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing GitHub for code review, CI, or merge serialization — Dolt holds intent + design, GitHub stays the source of truth for code state.
- Synchronous human approvals inside the agent loop — gates are status transitions in Dolt, not chat handoffs.
- Real-time push from operator → contributor in v0 — the broadcaster channel (idempotent PR comments) is filed in Open Questions, not in scope here.

## Design

The full design is the rest of this spec — Interaction Graph (component map), Roles + Surfaces, Status Machine, The Loop (as-built agent flow), Validation Contract, Auth Model, Contracts, and Invariants. Read top-to-bottom for first contact; jump to the section you need on subsequent reads.

## Roles + Surfaces

PR comments are **notifications**, never state of record. Design decisions live in Dolt `designs`. Status lives in Dolt `work_items`. Deploy state lives in `/version.buildSha`. Coordination state lives in operator Postgres.

| Surface                                | Carries                                          | Mutated by                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dolt `work_items`, `designs`           | status, design, outcome, validation block        | `/idea`, `/triage`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/closeout`, `/review-implementation`    |
| Operator Postgres `work_item_sessions` | claim, heartbeat, deadline, branch, pr_number    | `POST /claims`, `/heartbeat`, `/pr`                                                   |
| GitHub PR + CI                         | code, head SHA, required checks, merge state     | `git push`, `gh pr create`, GitHub Merge Queue                                        |
| GitHub PR comments                     | scorecards, operator nudges (vNext: broadcaster) | `/validate-candidate`, `cogni-git-review`, agent (rare), operator broadcaster (vNext) |

If something proposes a design change in a PR comment, that's a bug — capture it in Dolt via `/design` first.

## Status Machine

9 status values. Every `needs_*` status has exactly one command that resolves it.

```mermaid
graph LR
  idea["/idea"] --> needs_triage
  bug_cmd["/bug"] --> needs_triage
  needs_triage -->|"/triage: story"| done
  needs_triage -->|"/triage: spike"| needs_research

```

| Status            | Command                  | What happens                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `needs_triage`    | `/triage`                | Routes item; stories → `done`; tasks/bugs → next status             |
| `needs_research`  | `/research`              | Executes spike; spike → `done`; creates follow-up items             |
| `needs_design`    | `/design`                | Writes/updates spec; task/bug → `needs_implement`                   |
| `needs_implement` | `/implement`             | Writes code on branch                                               |
| `needs_closeout`  | `/closeout`              | Docs/headers pass + creates PR                                      |
| `needs_merge`     | `/review-implementation` | Reviews PR; APPROVE → `done` or REQUEST CHANGES → `needs_implement` |

Terminal: `done` (PR merged; `deploy_verified` tracked separately), `blocked` (`blocked_by:` required), `cancelled`.

### Triage routing

- `/triage` on **story** → story `done` (intake complete); may create task/bug items.
- `/triage` on **bug/task** routes to `needs_design` when ANY of: touches >1 module/package boundary; introduces a new port/schema column/HTTP contract; root cause unclear; >1 reasonable implementation exists. Otherwise → `needs_implement` directly.
- `/triage` on **spike** → `needs_research`.

### Loop limit

`revision: 0` field on the work item. Incremented each time `/review-implementation` sends an item back to `needs_implement`. `revision >= 5` → auto-set `blocked` with note "Review loop limit — escalate to human."

### Spec state lifecycle

| State        | Meaning                          | Required                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`      | Exploratory. May not match code. | Invariants can be incomplete. Open Questions allowed. |
| `proposed`   | Stable enough to review against. | Invariants enumerated. Acceptance checks defined.     |
| `active`     | Matches code. Enforced.          | Open Questions empty. `verified:` current.            |
| `deprecated` | No longer authoritative.         | Points to replacement spec.                           |

## The Loop — As Built (Agent Contribution)

External AI agent: discover → register → claim → push → flight → self-validate. No human required for routine merges.

### 1. Discover

```bash
BASE=https://test.cognidao.org
curl $BASE/.well-known/agent.json | jq .endpoints
```

The well-known doc is the only hard-coded URL. Everything else is discovered from it.

### 2. Register

```bash
API_KEY=$(curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/v1/agent/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"my-agent"}' | jq -r .apiKey)
```

Bearer token. Same `SessionUser.id` shape as a SIWE-authed human.

### 3. Adopt + claim a work item

Adopt **exactly one** work item (1 work item ≈ 1 PR). Prefer adopting an existing `needs_implement`/`needs_design` item over creating a new one.

```bash
# claim — once
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/v1/work/items/$ID/claims \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lastCommand":"/implement"}'

# heartbeat — every 5–10 min while active; deadline is 30 min
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/v1/work/items/$ID/heartbeat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lastCommand":"/implement"}'

# poll coordination — operator's pushback channel; obey nextAction
curl -s $BASE/api/v1/work/items/$ID/coordination \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" | jq .nextAction
```

The operator does **not** accept patches/diffs. Agents push their own branches via standard git.

### 4. Push branch + open PR + link

```bash
git push origin feat/my-change
gh pr create --title "feat: my change" --body "Opened by my-agent." --base main
PR_NUMBER=<number from gh output>

curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/v1/work/items/$ID/pr \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"branch\":\"feat/my-change\",\"prNumber\":$PR_NUMBER}"
```

`POST /pr` links the PR to both the operator session **and** the durable Dolt work item. The agent does not run `gh pr ready` here — PRs are not "ready for review" until step 7.

### 5. Wait for CI green

Watch required checks (`unit`, `component`, `static`, `manifest`) on the PR head SHA. Until they're green, the flight endpoint will reject with 422.

### 6. Request candidate-a flight

Use the flight lever that matches the artifact being deployed.

For an in-repo operator app PR, dispatch the workflow directly:

```bash
gh workflow run candidate-flight.yml -f pr_number=$PR_NUMBER
```

For an externally built node artifact, call the operator API with the node's
source identity:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $BASE/api/v1/vcs/flight \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"nodeRef":{"nodeId":"<node_id>","sourceSha":"<child_repo_main_sha>"}}'
```

The API response includes workflow dispatch metadata. The endpoint is a thin
gate: it authenticates the caller, checks node flight authorization when RBAC is
configured, verifies nodeRef source/image preflight, and dispatches
`candidate-flight.yml`. The candidate slot lease is owned by the workflow itself
([candidate-slot-controller](./candidate-slot-controller.md)) — the endpoint
does not replicate that lease.

### 7. Self-validate

After successful flight, hit your feature endpoint on `test.cognidao.org` (the candidate-a URL for operator) and confirm behavior. Run `/validate-candidate` — it owns the impact-matrix-and-Loki-marker scorecard. Post the scorecard as a PR comment.

This is the **real** validation gate (`SELF_VALIDATE` invariant). `status: done` is just the code gate; `deploy_verified: true` is the signal that the feature actually works on the deployed build.

### 8. Request merge

When validation passes, mark the PR ready and enqueue:

- `gh pr merge --auto --squash` (or UI "Merge when ready").
- GitHub Merge Queue rebases onto current `main`, re-runs the required checks, and merges deterministically. Agents never rebase.
- Required checks must fire on **both** `pull_request:` and `merge_group:` triggers (`REPORT_OR_DON'T_REQUIRE` invariant — see [merge-queue-config](./merge-queue-config.md)).

The agentic contribution loop terminates here. Post-merge, `push:main` triggers `flight-preview`, which auto-promotes the merged SHA to preview.

## Multi-Agent Roles

Distinct specialized agents own each lifecycle stage. No single agent runs the full loop.

| Agent             | Owns                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pr-manager`      | VCS orchestration: listPrs, getCiStatus, flightCandidate, monitor Argo, verify SHA, request merge        |
| `gov-engineering` | Dispatch loop: reads work queue → invokes `/design`, `/implement`, `/closeout`, `/review-implementation` |
| `pr-review`       | Code-quality review on PR open/update (cogni-git-review GitHub App)                                      |
| `qa-agent`        | Post-flight feature validation (task.0309) — manual predecessor is `/validate-candidate`                 |
| `frontend-tester` | Playwright click-through (delegated by qa-agent for UI paths)                                            |

`POST /api/v1/vcs/flight` is the **nodeRef primitive** for externally built node artifacts (deterministic dispatch — agent knows the source SHA and wants to fly now). Direct workflow dispatch remains the in-repo operator app PR lever. `pr-manager` is the **policy** layer (decides when to fly, monitors rollout, verifies SHA, requests merge). Do not add policy logic to the REST endpoint.

| Responsibility            | `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight` | `pr-manager`          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Verify CI green           | ✅                        | ✅                    |
| Dispatch candidate-flight | ✅                        | ✅                    |
| Acquire slot lease        | ❌ (workflow owns it)     | ❌ (workflow owns it) |
| Monitor Argo rollout      | ❌                        | ✅                    |
| Verify deployed SHA       | ❌                        | ✅                    |
| Exercise feature + Loki   | ❌                        | ✅ (validate step)    |
| Request merge (enqueue)   | ❌                        | ✅                    |
| Rebase + retest + merge   | ❌ (merge queue owns)     | ❌ (merge queue owns) |

## Validation Contract

Every task and bug **must** include a `## Validation` section before `/closeout` creates the PR (`VALIDATION_REQUIRED`):

```markdown
## Validation

exercise: |
POST https://test.cognidao.org/api/v1/<feature>
Authorization: Bearer <CANDIDATE_TOKEN>
body: {...}
assert: response.status == 200, body matches <shape>

observability: |
{namespace="cogni-candidate-a"} | json | msg="<feature-specific-event>"
expect: ≥1 entry within 60s of exercise

smoke_cmd: |
curl -sf https://test.cognidao.org/api/v1/health | jq '.status == "ok"'
```

`exercise:` + `observability:` are the qa-agent's test specification (`QA_READS_TASK`). `smoke_cmd:` is an optional shell fallback. Generic `/readyz` traffic is not proof (`FEATURE_LOG_PROOF`).

## Deploy Verification

`status: done` = PR merged (code gate — unchanged).

`deploy_verified: true` = qa-agent / `/validate-candidate` confirmed post-flight (set autonomously when):

1. `candidate-flight` status = success on PR head SHA
2. Health scorecard returns: restarts=0, memory < 90% of limit, oom_kills=0
3. Feature exercise from the work item's `## Validation` block passes against the deployed URL
4. Observability signal confirmed in Loki at the deployed SHA

E2E success: one work item reaches `deploy_verified=true` via fully automated pipeline.

## Auth Model

| Method       | Source                        | Scope                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Bearer token | `POST /api/v1/agent/register` | Machine agent; read/write to own resources |
| SIWE session | Browser wallet sign-in        | Human operator; same route access          |

All contribution endpoints require auth (`AUTH_REQUIRED`). No publicly writable endpoints.

## Contracts

| Contract                                                             | Location                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight`                                            | `packages/node-contracts/src/vcs.flight.v1.contract.ts`              |
| Agent registration                                                   | `packages/node-contracts/src/agent-register.v1.contract.ts`          |
| Work-item sessions (`/claims`, `/heartbeat`, `/pr`, `/coordination`) | `nodes/operator/app/src/contracts/work-item-sessions.v1.contract.ts` |
| Work items (CRUD + PATCH)                                            | `packages/node-contracts/src/work.items.*.v1.contract.ts`            |

## PR Body Format

```markdown
## References

Work: task.0042
Spec: docs/spec/feature.md#invariants (or Spec-Impact: none)
```

Missing `Work:` → merge blocked. Missing `Spec:` → warning (blocked if behavior/security/interface change).

## Invariants

| Rule                        | Constraint                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STATUS_COMMAND_MAP`        | Every `needs_*` status has exactly one command. No ambiguity.                                                                         |
| `BRANCH_REQUIRED`           | `branch:` must be set when status ∈ {`needs_implement`, `needs_closeout`, `needs_merge`}. `/implement` creates if missing.            |
| `PR_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED`      | `pr:` must be set before entering `needs_merge`.                                                                                      |
| `BLOCKED_EVIDENCE`          | `blocked_by:` must be set when status = `blocked`.                                                                                    |
| `CLEAN_WORKTREE_ON_EXIT`    | `/implement` and `/closeout` must end with clean `git status`.                                                                        |
| `COMMIT_ON_PROGRESS`        | Commands that change repo files must end with ≥1 commit. Review-only commands are exempt.                                             |
| `CLAIM_REQUIRED`            | Governance runner sets `claimed_by_run` before acting. Prevents double-dispatch.                                                      |
| `LOOP_LIMIT`                | `revision >= 5` → `blocked` with escalation note.                                                                                     |
| `STORIES_ARE_INTAKE`        | Stories go `done` after triage. Never enter implementation lifecycle.                                                                 |
| `DEPLOY_VERIFIED_SEPARATE`  | `done` = merged (code gate). `deploy_verified` = qa-agent confirmed post-flight. Never conflate.                                      |
| `VALIDATION_REQUIRED`       | Every task/bug must have `## Validation` with `exercise:` + `observability:` before `/closeout` creates PR.                           |
| `FEATURE_SMOKE_SCOPED`      | qa-agent validation must exercise the specific feature, not just generic `/readyz`.                                                   |
| `QA_READS_TASK`             | qa-agent derives its test from the work item `## Validation` block — not from a separate test file.                                   |
| `PR_LINKS_ITEM`             | Every code PR references exactly one primary work item (`task.*` or `bug.*`) and at least one spec, or `Spec-Impact: none`.           |
| `TRIAGE_OWNS_ROUTING`       | Only `/triage` sets or changes the `project:` linkage on an idea or bug.                                                              |
| `SPEC_NO_EXEC_PLAN`         | Specs never contain roadmap, phases, tasks, owners, or timelines. At any `spec_state`.                                                |
| `SPEC_STATE_LIFECYCLE`      | `draft` → `proposed` → `active` → `deprecated`. No skipping.                                                                          |
| `ACTIVE_MEANS_CLEAN`        | `spec_state: active` requires Open Questions empty and `verified:` current.                                                           |
| `REVIEW_BEFORE_MERGE`       | `/review-implementation` runs at `needs_merge` (reviews the PR, not pre-PR code).                                                     |
| `MACHINE_READABLE_ENTRY`    | All endpoints discoverable via `/.well-known/agent.json`; no hardcoded URLs in agent code.                                            |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED`             | No contribution endpoint is publicly writable.                                                                                        |
| `CI_GATE`                   | `/api/v1/vcs/flight` verifies CI is green for the exact PR head SHA before dispatching.                                               |
| `NO_LEASE_SPLIT_BRAIN`      | Slot lease lives on the deploy branch (candidate-slot-controller); the flight endpoint does not write a competing lease.              |
| `PRIMITIVE_OVER_POLICY`     | `/api/v1/vcs/flight` is a primitive action; pr-manager is the policy layer; do not add flight logic to the REST endpoint.             |
| `OSS_FOR_CODE_WORK`         | Agents use standard git + `gh pr create` for code contribution; the operator provides only the flight gate and the coordination port. |
| `SELF_VALIDATE`             | Agents validate their own changes on candidate-a; `deploy_verified: true` is the real gate, not `status: done`.                       |
| `FEATURE_LOG_PROOF`         | Post-flight validation must tie Loki evidence to the exercised feature route/tool/graph, not ambient pod traffic.                     |
| `MERGE_QUEUE_DETERMINISM`   | Rebase + retest + merge is owned by GitHub Merge Queue; agents only request merge.                                                    |
| `NO_AGENTIC_REBASE`         | No LLM in the merge path; rebase is a vendor primitive (GH Merge Queue) so the merge sequence is auditable and reproducible.          |
| `COMMENTS_ARE_NOTIFICATION` | GitHub PR comments carry scorecards + nudges. Design decisions and status mutations belong in Dolt, never in comment threads.         |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Operator broadcaster v0 (push nudges via PR comments using `<!-- cogni-coord-v0 -->` marker). Designed in [`docs/design/operator-dev-lifecycle-coordinator.md`](../design/operator-dev-lifecycle-coordinator.md). Until built, the loop closes only when contributors poll `GET /coordination`.
- [ ] Migrate this spec into the Dolt knowledge port (task.0001). Until then, it lives in markdown.
- [ ] CI enforcement of PR body format (`Work:` / `Spec:` lines).
- [ ] Lint specs for roadmap/phase language (`SPEC_NO_EXEC_PLAN` enforcement).
